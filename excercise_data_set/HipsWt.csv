254,Suspended Mountain Climber,['Auxiliary'],['Compound'],['Pull'],"Sit on floor facing suspension trainer loops in low position. Place right foot in left lower loop. Cross left leg over right leg placed in right lower loop. Turn body to right and place hands on floor, shoulder width apart. Turn body to kneel on hands and knees. Reposition hands (shoulder width or slightly wider) at desired distance from suspension trainer so that body is square with suspension trainer straps. With arms straight, raise knees from ground so body is supported by arms and suspension trainer. Bend one leg so knee is pointing down while keeping other leg extended out straight.","Simultaneously alternate leg positions by straightening bent leg behind, while bending straight leg forward. Repeat.","Attempt to straighten hip each stroke, while maintaining approximate height of hips from floor throughout movement.

256,Cable Lying Hip External Rotation,['Auxiliary'],['Isolated'],['Pull'],"Attach cable ankle cuff to ankle, nearest low pulley. Lie prone with legs slightly apart and knee of attached leg bent 90°. Adjust position of legs slightly away from cable pulley so slight stretch is felt in hip.","Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90°, pull cable attachment toward opposite knee by rotating hip. Return until slight stretch is felt in hip, then repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue lying opposite direction.","Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction of rotation is relative to movement of hip, or thigh, not bent leg. For example, in this exercises, external rotation of hip causes front of thigh to turn outward despite bent leg moving inward.

257,Cable Seated Hip External Rotation,['Auxiliary'],['Isolated'],['Pull'],"Sit on bench or chair with low pulley to side. Attach cable ankle cuff to ankle, nearest pulley. Place far stationary foot slightly forward. Grasp lower thigh of leg with attached cuff, position it along side thigh of stationary leg while keeping foot slightly above floor.","Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90°, pull cable attachment under thigh of stationary leg by rotating hip. Return until slight stretch is felt in hip, then repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue facing opposite direction.","Height of knee on exercising leg may require subtle adjustment during movement to permit clearance of traveling foot above floor. Gluteus Maximus will be activated as stabilizer on heavier loads when participant pushes stationary foot onto floor thereby anchoring lower body as hip adductors keep thighs together. Upper body muscles can also assist in keeping thigh of exercising leg along side stationary leg.
