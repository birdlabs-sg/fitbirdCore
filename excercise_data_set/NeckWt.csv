24,Band Resistive Neck Retraction,['Auxiliary'],['Isolated'],['Pull'],"Execution
Push back of neck into band by retracting head. Returning head to neutral postion and repeat.",,This exercise may be prescribed for functional forward head posture since it strengthens Splenius without neck flexion. Neck retraction primarily consists of Cervical Flexion (spine) accompanied by subtle Thoracic Flexion (spine) and Neck Flexion (atlanto-occipital joint). Cervical spine has natural lordotic curvature (see diagram of spine). Much of the retraction motion is actually flattening or slight reversing the normal lordosis. The deep neck flexors perform majority of movement. Slight neck Flexion at the atlanto-occipital joint also occurs to maintain forward head positioning.,['Splenius'],[],"['Trapezius, Upper', 'Levator Scapulae', 'Erector Spinae, Cervicis & Capitis Fibers', 'Longus capitis', 'Longus colli', 'Rectus capitus']",[]
